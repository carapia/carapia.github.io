I used to be in the Army and went to Iraq. It was really hot there and uncomfortable no matter what you did, but one day I was in a rush and didn't put on underwear, and found it much more comfortable and cool. Everyday after that I stopped wearing them. It is a more primative, yet confident feel. Now that I am out of the Army, the habit just stuck. The idea of underwear is something engrained in our minds and really only has practical purpose in certain situations. Freeballing is a progression back to an older, wiser state. Think of all the great men who went sans underwear.... Alexander the Great, King Tut, Jesus, Ghandi, Christopher Columbus, and Kramer of Seinfeld, to name a few. When you are walking down the street, free and open, you look at other men and you can see the strain and constriction on their faces. Freeballing gives a natural and inward confidence, knowing that your manhood faces no prision and is only a quick zipper away from freedom. Women can also see this confidence immediately, thus bettering your chances with the opposite sex. Outting the skivies is also an obvious economic choice. Since the average male's laundry bag's mass is 19% underwear, I estimate I have saved nearly $134 dollars per year on detergent and dryer sheets.
